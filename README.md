# Quiz-App

As a web developer, I wanted to build a Quiz-App so that I can practice the fundamentals of JavaScript. I learned how to implement Font Awesome and got comfortable with using `document.querySelector`. Quiz-App is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to participate in quizzes and test their knowledge on various topics. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup and usage, and additional details to help you get started.
